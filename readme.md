#### MySomm. is a queryable  web application that exists to help users quickly discover and make great decisions about wine. It was created with the hope that its users could confidently make decisions about how they spend their money as well as discover new wines they may not be familiar with.

<br>

Users are able to create profiles based on two useage categories: winery owners and enthusiats.  Any of our users may search for and find wines as well as leave comments on and rate their favorites.  Winery owners my also share information about their own winery as well as the wines that they produce.  These wines will then be added to our database as searchable results.
